## 2 months / 10 weeks GRE prep strategy 


1. Before starting the preparation, take the free [Manhattan Prep mock test](https://www.manhattanprep.com/gre/free-gre-practice-test/). The test scores will give you a fair idea about your current preparedness. Go through the assessment report and make a note of which sections you didn’t perform well in an increasing order of preparedness.

2. Download Magoosh GRE vocabulary flashcards app and Magoosh Vocabulary builder app. Take the 90 days subscription to Galvanize GRE test prep (offers 5 full length mock tests with AWA grading and excellent preparation materials) or Manhattan prep practice exams for 6 months (6 full length mock tests without AWA grading, no study materials).

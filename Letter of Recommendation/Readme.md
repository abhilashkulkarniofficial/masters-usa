# Letter of Recommendation Section

## General Outline of the Recommendation Letter

Recommendation letters are letters written by professors who know you, assessing your capacity to meet the requirements of a program you are applying for. They're supposed to help decision-makers to get a better picture of your potential. 

### First Paragraph

Recommendation letter usually includes the title of the recommender, together with the name of the student for whom the letter is written. The recommender should also state since when has s/he known the students: year, class or other activity. It should in any case be clear that the professor had the opportunity to get to know the student well and assess his/her capabilities. If the person does research work under your guidance, indicate the type of research, the responsibilities of the student, and any significant projects undertaken by the individual. You may wish to include a sentence about the nature of your research group and its activities.. 


### Next  Paragraph

The assessment of the studentâ€™s capabilities should be made from a multiple point of view over the next paragraphs. From a professional point of view, it should give an account of the studentâ€™s knowledge, interests and capabilities, activities and results, work capacity, etc. Personally, it should assess the studentâ€™s personal characteristics, character, social skills, his or her relations with the students and professors. Same as in other application documents, the direction should be from facts/experience to qualifications, and from those, to value judgments. Especially those skills relevant to the desired program should be outlined throughout the paper.

Concentrate on several different aspects of the person. Specifically identify his/her skills, attitudes, personal attributes, and growth, as well as his/her contributions and performance within your organization. 

Beware of the power of words! Some words seem harmless in everyday conversation, but carry positive or negative connotations to a prospective employer. 

#### Avoid bland words such as: 
nice, good, fairly, reasonable, decent, satisfactory, I hope, for sure 

#### Use powerful words such as: 
articulate, effective, sophisticated, intelligent, observant, significant, expressive, creative, efficient, cooperative, imaginative, assertive, dependable, mature, innovative 

#### Some excellent points to address would be the following: 
ability to communicate, intelligence, self-confidence, willingness to accept responsibility, initiative, leadership, energy level, imagination, flexibility, interpersonal skills, self-knowledge, ability to handle conflict, goal achievement, competitiveness, appropriate research skills, direction. 


### Final Paragraph

The final paragraph should provide an overall assessment of the studentâ€™s potential to fulfill the requirements of the program, even though partial judgments can and should be provided in the body of the letter.   Finally, indicate the degree to which you recommend the individual to the program she or he is seeking:  strongly recommend, highly recommend.

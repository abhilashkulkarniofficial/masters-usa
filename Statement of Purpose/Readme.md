# Statement of Purpose

## How to write a Statement of Purpose as expected by the admissions committee?

Statement of Purpose is your academic biography about who you are, what has influenced your career path so far, your professional interests and where you plan to go from here, and also what would be your future accomplishments. It is a chance to talk to the admissions committee indirectly.  So, you should show your spark and uniqueness to stand out from similar academic profile students.  The statement of purpose should convince readersâ€“ the faculty on the selection committeeâ€“ that you have solid achievements behind you that show  for your success in selected subject of study.

Firstly, while drafting the statement of purpose, you must do the partition of elements.  It should be coherent and relevant.  The elements can be:

### Introduce yourself -   Introduce yourself, your motivation, interests

Mention what you are interested in and what sparked your desire for graduate study. This should be short and to the point; donâ€™t spend a great deal of time on autobiography.

### Summarize your undergraduate and previous graduate career

Include the following aspects:

* An important paper or project you completed, anything scholarly beyond your curricular requirements.
* Research you conducted; indicate with whom, the title of the project, what your responsibilities were, and the outcome.  Write technically, or in the style of your discipline/program. 
* Work experience, especially if you had any kind of responsibility for testing, designing, researching or interning in an area similar to what you wish to study in graduate school.
 
### Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities

If you had worked prior to returning to grad school, indicate what youâ€™ve been doing: company, your work/design team, responsibilities, what you learned. You can also indicate here how this helped you focus your graduate studies.  If you hold any certifications, discuss the skills obtained and its importance during graduate studies.
 
### Elaborate on your academic interests

In this section, indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of the program. Indicate the area of your interests, look on the web for information about departments youâ€™re interested.
 
### Conclusion

Conclude your statement in a positive manner, indicating your excitement and readiness for the challenges ahead of you and believing in your strengths to meet the eligibility of the department for admission.
 
Essential Tips:
1. What the admissions committee will read between the lines: self-motivation, competence, potential as a graduate student.
2. Emphasize everything from a positive perspective and write in an active, not a passive voice.
3. Demonstrate everything by example; donâ€™t say directly that youâ€™re a persistent person, show it.
4.  Write it affirmatively, showing your perseverance despite obstacles. 
5. Make sure everything is linked with continuity and focus.
6. It should be oneâ€™s best writing and it should be written technically not poetically.
6. Unless the specific program says otherwise, be concise; an ideal essay should say everything it needs to with brevity. Approximately 500 to 800 well-selected words (1-2 single space pages in 12 point font) are better than more words with less clarity and poor organization.

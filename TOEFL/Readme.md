# TOEFL Section

## TOEFL Test prep strategy

### Reading Section

The reading section of TOEFL is similar to that of GRE. If you're prepared for GRE reading section, you're prepared for TOEFL reading section as well. Nevertheless, use the Official TOEFL guide (in the Books folder) to practice TOEFL's reading section and you'll be good. Make sure you revise all the words you've memorised during GRE prep.

### Listening Section

The Listening section has 3 types of questions. You're supposed to listen to the lecture and answer the questions. Once you've listened to the audio, you will not be able to listen to the audio while answering the questions. In a few questions, you will be given a part of the audio clip specific to that question.

A few tips to prepare for this section:
* Listen to the audio very carefully.
* Use the pen and paper to note down as much information as you can when the audio is being played.

Use the following video to prepare for the listening section:

### Writing Section

The Writing section has 2 types of essays, Independent essay and Integrated Essay. 

According to the Official Guide, in an integrated essay *you will read a passage about an academic topic for three minutes, and then you will hear a short lecture related to the topic. Then you will be asked to summarize the points in the listening passage and explain how they relate to specific points in the reading passage* and in an independent essay *you are presented with a question, and you have 30 minutes to write an essay in response. The question asks you to give your opinion on an issue.* 

At first this sounds like a daunting task but this is the easiest section for you to score high. Just practice the following templates and read the official guide and you'll be ready for this section.
